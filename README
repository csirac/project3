What is working: A pastry network is created according to the specifications
given, with arbitrary number of nodes.  Each node then sends a user-specified
number of messages, one per second. A message is of the form 
(String, Key), where Key is a class containing a number (indicating where
the message is to be routed), an actorref (only used for join messages),
and a counter, to determine how many times the message is passed to
nodes throughout the network.  

The messages sent by the nodes are a randomly generated string, to be routed
to a randomly chosen number, between 0 and 2^128 - 1.

The largest network we constructed had 20000 nodes, with 4 messages sent
per node.  The average number of jumps was 5.
